	<p>Born and raised in Los Angeles, I have been out here all of my life.  I grew up surfing and snowboarding around Southern California.  
	   I graduated from California State University, Northridge with a degree in Public Relations.  I have worked in various fields and
	   gone back to school multiple times.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I have one brother and one sister.  At the moment I do not have any pets.  I live in Sherman Oaks but would love to evenytually 
		move to Portland or Seattle.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Currently working with software support, but have always wanted to learn how to do programming.  I am interested in wed development,
	   game development and Adroid/iOS app development.  I hope to learn a lot in this course so that I can apply towards advancing 
	   my career.</p>
